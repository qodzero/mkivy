mKivy
===========

This is a simple script I use to boostrap a kivy project.
**NOTE**: This script doesnt install anything or check anything, it simple justs creates a project structure I always use for my kivy projects.

## Description

What this does is simply take a path to where you want to create your project and generates a project structure with some boilerplate code.
In the end, when the script is done, simply:
* `cd <your_project> && python main.py`

### How to use
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:qodzero/mkivy.git`
2. Add it to your path, the easiest way: `cp -v ./mkivy/mkivy /usr/bin`
3. Create a project: `mkivy myproj`
4. Navigate to your created project: `cd myproj`
5. Run the project: `python main.py`
6. If your kivy is configured correctly, you should see a blank white window :)
